# TTGProtect [![Version Branch](https://img.shields.io/badge/branch-master-green.svg)](https://github.com/ttgprotect/ttgprotect)
The discord moderation bot for everyone, open-source

## Self-Hosting
Here's a quick guide on how to self-host TTGProtect:
1. Download the files
2. Edit `Configuration/config.json` with the correct info for your bot
3. Run the bot.js file! All should go well :)

## Web-Dashboard
The web-dashboard files can be found [here](https://github.com/ttgprotect/TTGProtect-WebDashboard)
\nYou will need to run these files in the same directory as the bot's files, more info at the repo

## Contributing
You sure can! Here are a few guidlines though:
- It must follow the same coding style as ours
- It must be appropiate
- You must describe what you changed in the PR for the Devs to know wether to merge or not
